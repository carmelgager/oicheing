I'm pretty sure this video was originally recorded on an Olympus camera, but using their "Olympus Viewer 3" program still won't let me play the AVI file. I read that AVI files should begin in the hex program with "RI FF", which this one does not. Does that mean anything? The first methods I tried were to rename the file into mov, mpg, mpeg, wmv, mp4, but none of these worked. Популярность программы.

If I convert RAW file into TIFF (and choose the best settings possible to preserve information), is there any loss of information? To make it more clear. A lot of people say, that Lightroom doesn't work well with raw files from Olympus cameras. So if I make bit of processing in Olympus Viewer and then save the file to TIFF and import it to Lightroom for further editing, will I lose some information or not? Thanks.

I have recently bought an Olympus omd m10 and I shoot it raw, the files are .orf and windows photo viewer doesnt support that. I am currently importing all photos from the SD card into lightroom, but it's a pain bc I would like to be able to preview them before deciding whether to edit them or not. I tried downloading Olympus viewer 3 but its pretty slow to open up the files. What do you guys use? Any ideas/advice? thanks so much (btw this is my first reddit Октябрь 2011 компьютерно-техническая экспертиза elcomsoft distributed password recovery не работает. I jumped into photography about a year ago, and like most folks I've slowly fallen up the complexity curve from SOOC jpegs to edited jpegs to RAW processing. Along the way I've dabbled with a few software options, and right now I've settled on using Olympus Viewer 3 for my RAW processing, and in the 5-10% of the time I need additional tools, I've been using Picasa 3 for cloning out blemishes, Hugin for panoramas, and RIOT for web resizing. If I'm just posting on mobile, Snapseed has been amazing.  
SOLVED Hi there, I've participated Olympus Photography Playground event where I had a chance to play with E-M10 mk III. I have the pictures with me, though I decided to use RAW format. Now, neither Lightroom or DNG Converter seem to be able to process it. Is there any way to convert MK3's files to DNG or simply open them? Edit: Apparently the only way to open MK3's RAWs is to export them to JPG/TIFF via the latest version of Olympus Viewer. Having just purchased an E-M10 II, I'm wondering what's the best RAW converter? Adobe Camera Raw, Olympus Viewer 3 or something else? I mainly shoot landscapes if that makes any difference. Cheers. Lightroom has neither the color profiles nor the lens profiles for Panasonic camera's. As far as I know Panasonic doesn't have its own editing software like Olympus' viewer. Does anybody have any ideas or know of software to edit Panasonic images on. Panasonic users, what do you use to edit your images. I was reading a blog post by Daniel Cox on Naturalexposures.com ( about the new Panasonic 100-400mm and the author mentioned that he got a lot of feedback on his post processing which he had done wrong. I'm just wondering if there are any post processing guides for specifically dealing with Panasonic raw files (I have a GX8). I've read an article by Robin Wong for processing for the web, but it was Olympus centric. My output. Hey, As the title says how can I batch process several RAW files in Olympus Viewer 3 ? I can see the 'Save Batch Processing File" under the edit menu in the menubar but it's greyed out. I didn't make any changes to my files to be included in the batch processing though. I just want to convert them from orf to 8bit tiff's. Can someone explain me how I can do this or maybe link me to a tutorial ? Thanks in advance. When I import RAW files from my Olympus OM-D into LR4, it loads the thumbnails and they look fine. Then it appears as if LR goes back and applies a color profile to each photo that ruins the colors -- it darkens significantly, the colors become muted, and it generally looks like crap. From this point I can't get the colors back to where I want them. If I use Olympus Viewer to adjust the color then export to TIFF and import those TIFFs into LR, everything is fine just as it is if I shoot TL;DR - Weird request, but could someone with an Olympus camera PM me their serial so I can download Olympus Viewer 3 ( I started a new job and the person before me had taken quite a few photos with their own camera. I'm trying to edit a few of them, but can't open ORF files on my computer. Photoshop RAW and Adobe DNG converter won't work. I've had no luck with freeware other than the official Olympus Viewer. However, while it's freeware. 
Hi folks, First post here; hope this type of newb question is not entirely frowned upon. I've recently acquired an Olympus OM-D and I'm really loving it. I've always wanted a decent camera and have finally managed to get one! I have a question regarding some of the things I'm seeing on my first few images. Have a look at these couple shots: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a2a4t3mguezvw50/oBtG7tcT7- NOTE: click the small elipsis in the bottom right-hand corner of the pics and choose 'view origina. Hey all, Seems like there aren't a lot of great explanations to the ending of KH3, so I figured I'd take a more detailed stab at it and weave some commentary/opinion in as well. Enjoy!

Well, we've finally finished the OG series, and I must say, it's been a real blast re-reading the books then giving my thoughts on them, and thank you to all of those who have been reading and interacting with the posts. The next series will be the Heroes of Olympus series, as voted for by you. I will be doing Trials of Apollo last as it is the chronological latest series he has done, after Heroes though, it will be either Kane Chronicles or Magnus Chase, I'll post a Straw Poll when I'm nearly. 
I went down to r/analog yesterday with Portra 400, the son of Kodak, to upload a picture of the Godess; and, at the same time, I wanted to observe how they would put on the festival, since they were now holding it for the first time. Now, in my opinion, the procession of the native inhabitants were fine; but the one the Film Photographers conducted no less a fitting show. After we had prayed and looked on, we went off toward upvotes. \-Socrates in the opening words of Plato's The Republic. So I've never written any scripts, drawn storyboards, and I have virtually no knowledge with how television shows are produced. So my input in this subject should be completely discarded as I have no idea what I'm talking about right? Yes, but I'm inputting it anyways. Kingdom Hearts has twice been attempted to be made into an animated series by a guy named Seth Kearsley. He directed many episodes of the recent Looney Tunes Show and is a storyboard artist for several Illumination movies. Howeve. Hello. I was using Pentax K-S2 before. Its zoomed live view is very useful while taking photos in very low light. When I zoom to max level I'm able to precisely set focus. I can also use optical viewer but found that live view is much more precise. After switching to Olympus I see that viewer has refresh rate priority. It's much more responsive but noises make it not usable to use manual focus. It's better to use autofocus. or use hyperfocal distance with wide lenses. Is there To Herbert G. McGee, my dearest friend, I have always been a big fan of Noah “The Spoony One” Antwiler. His videos are absolutely great, and I’ve loved them since childhood. So you can hopefully understand the intense pain I feel every time I look at his website and Twitter account and see him slowly but surely turn into a walking corpse. Every day it seems that he has some new, horrible disease plaguing his body, and seems to be bitter at the world, it’s just a depressing mess. But recently. Let me first say that I love the game, it was the only MOBA I actually enjoyed. I tried League, Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm but SMITE made it possible for me to enjoy a MOBA without being a top-down. The 3rd person perspective is what really sold the game to me in the first place. The game has made a LOT of improvements, don't get me wrong. I'm talking about the optimization of the game that was done with Project Olympus as well as a lot Quality of Life improvements. The commendation system.

Hi! Below is a piece of writing I worked on for school. Was just after some second opinions and maybe some feedback! (if you can take the time to read it). Thankqqqq amp#x200B; God of War is a story-driven video game.

I was having a very insomniac Sunday and Monday evening, so when Tuesday evening came around I fell asleep at the comically early 8 in the morning and didn’t wake up until I went to bed.
